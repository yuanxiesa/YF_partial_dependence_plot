# Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)

## Description
This repository holds materials for teaching the principles behind partial dependence plot (PDP) and related code.

## File description
**Partial Dependence Plot.pptx**: slides for the lesson

**PDP_DALEX_implementation.R**: implementation of PDP in R with the DALEX package

## Associated reading material
For a general introduction to PDP, refer to Section 8.1 of Christoph Molnar's book [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/pdp.html). Currently, my lesson is based on this section.

For a quick glance of DALEX (Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations), I recommend reading the index page of its API reference (https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/reference/index.html)

Przemyslaw Biecek and Tomasz Burzykowski wrote a book ["Explore, Explain, and Examine Predictive Models. With examples in R and Python"](https://ema.drwhy.ai/). Read it if you want to learn more about DALEX.
